# proposal-deadline-countdown

With the patient help of ChatGPT, I finally got a countdown timer to remind me to prepare my proposals.

Usage:

python countdown.py

in terminal.

Or click the countdown.app file in mac. The app is generated by: pyinstaller --onefile --windowed countdown.py

The deadline time error can be about 1 hour, depending on how the code interprets the deadlines given on the proposal call webpage.

This is 2025A version.
